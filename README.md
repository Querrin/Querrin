### Information
Currently studying CS in highschool and primarily a .NET Core developer. I like learning how advanced stuff works and personally love IT. I'm mostly focusing on web development (because stuff flying through the internet is fun) using ASP.NET Core MVC, but also program some game software time to time.

Currently working on EndShop and some secret projects :D
